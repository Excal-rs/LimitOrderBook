# Limit Order Book

This project aims to create a `limit order book`.

### What is a limit order book?
A *limit order book* is a record of buy and sell limit orders for things such as stocks or crypto. Each *order* specifies a price and quantity that a trader is either willing to sell or buy (also called *bid* and *ask* respectively).

The order book is usually ordered, with the highest *bids* and lowest *asks* being displayed at the top.

### What will my order book do?
For me to consider this project as completed the following things must be completed:

- Record and store bid and ask orders
- Automatically match compatible orders
- Maintain a ordered list of orders
- Simulate trades and stock prices for testing

### Why I chose this project?
I want to learn C++ and I already know how to program and think logically - because of this I have decided to learn by diving straight into developing a project.

I chose creating a *limit order book* as my project because of the amount of skills I could cover when creating it:
- Core programming concepts, e.g. **data structures**
- Provides the option to use **OOP** if I want to do so
- Sorting the orders and matching them may require me to implement **Algorithms**
- Potential to implement **Concurrency**
